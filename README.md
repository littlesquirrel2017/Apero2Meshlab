Apero2Meshlab
=============

Code file CPP_Apero2Meshlab.cpp should be placed in the src/uti_files/ dir of micmac. 
Also Apero2Meshlab.c should be copied in the right place.
And then also other changes to the micmac code are needed in order to work!

I provide a bash script for applying the patch and copying the files.

Run it as:
```bash
./intall_patch.sh path/to/micmac_source [-r]
```

where:	

	-r undo the changes
